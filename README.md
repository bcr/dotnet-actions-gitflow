# .NET GitHub Actions and Gitflow Example

The way I initially created the repo is as follows:

```bash
~/Source/bcr/dotnet-actions-gitflow$ git flow init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/blakeramsdell/Source/bcr/dotnet-actions-gitflow/.git/
No branches exist yet. Base branches must be created now.
Branch name for production releases: [master]
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/]
Bugfix branches? [bugfix/]
Release branches? [release/]
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
Support branches? [support/]
Version tag prefix? []
Hooks and filters directory? [/Users/blakeramsdell/Source/bcr/dotnet-actions-gitflow/.git/hooks]
~/Source/bcr/dotnet-actions-gitflow$
```
